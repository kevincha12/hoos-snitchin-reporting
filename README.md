# UVA CS3240 - Advanced Software Development Project

__Group Members:__ Ryland Birchmeier, Kevin Cha, Kimberly Liu, Helena Moore, Andy Wang

__Personal Contributinons:__ In this project, we followed an agile development process and utilized sprints to track progress and meet goals. In the project, we each emulated a team by taking on differing team roles such as Scrum Master, Elicitation Requirements Manager, DevOps Manager, Software Architect, and Testing Manager. I was personally the Testing Manager, setting up Github Actions for automation of testing. I also spearheaded the beta testing, creating scripts for different user types to elicit feedback on user concerns of functionality and UI/UX. Aside from my duties as a Testing Manager, I worked primarily on the backend of the project, contributing mostly to the models and views, as well as basic HTML template creation. I also ensured that major and minor bugs were handled by executing multiple system tests throughout the sprints and making fixes as necessary.
